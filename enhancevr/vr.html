            <h2>#1 -- Full Sensory Immersion</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for technology is to improve our lives. It's at the
                heart of innovation and design. No matter what type of
                technology we're discussing, its ultimate aim has been to make
                things just a little bit better or easier for us.

            <h2>#2 -- The Rise of a Virtual Social Network</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine having the ability to go out and meet new people, form
                bonds, and even network with other business owners without ever
                having to leave your home. Yes, this is something the Internet
                has afforded us the opportunity to do today, but imagine doing
                it as your virtual self.

            <h2>#3 -- Augment the Ease of Learning Complex Things</h2>
            <p>
                The efficiency of our education is increased whenever we learn
                something by not only hearing about it by reading it in some
                book, but also by listening to it and actually doing it. Virtual
                reality will afford us the opportunity to do and learn complex
                things at a moment's notice.

            <h2>#4 -- Proving Grounds for Difficult Circumstances</h2>
            <p>
                Virtual reality will make seemingly impossible tasks much
                simpler. Military applications are one such realm where this
                technology will blossom. The ability to find yourself in an
                immersive hostile environment without the risk of real bodily
                harm, yet have the ability to learn and study your surroundings
                through military-style drills, raids, and invasions will likely
                be the assistive platform for future battles in the real world.

            <h2>#5 -- Ease of Accessibility through a Lower-Price Point</h2>
            <p>
                While Google suffered a minor setback with Glass, its augmented
                reality headpiece, it's surely paved the way for future
                iterations that will most likely be far less expensive and
                invasive on others' privacy.
