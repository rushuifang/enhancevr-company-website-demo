            <p>
                As a company we seek to create, combine and innovate XR
                technologies. Our product in development, Project Elucid Locus
                (P.E.L. - Latin for "enlightenment room"), embodies our
                company's goal to make experiences that engage, educate and
                inspire our users.<br />

                It's a one-design virtual reality room for dozens of users at
                once. By incorporating interactions between users, cloud based
                systems, haptics and customization of content - it's becoming
                hands down, the ultimate learning tool. Initially targeted for
                K-12 schools, the same technology can revolutionize engineering
                design, workforce development and more as we develop the
                platform. <br />

                It gives teachers the ability to immerse their students in the
                content they want to teach and give students the opportunity to
                defy the status quo by allowing them to explore, learn and
                retain information in a more meaningful way. <br />

                P.E.L. could truly change playing games to learning, assessments
                to excitement, and education to exploration.
