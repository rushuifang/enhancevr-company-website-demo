                        The internationally known company, Siemens, hosted a
                        STEM event at the Koffman Southern Tier Incubator with
                        intent to create a new “STEM Hub”. STEM, an acronym for
                        Science, Technology, (Arts), and Mathematics, is a
                        common term associated with modern teaching practices
                        that covers more fundamentals of engineering and
                        innovation in classrooms. Promptly titled “STEM Pathway
                        to Jobs”, dozens of local school districts, BOCEs
                        programs, and many manufactures turned out to take a big
                        step in developing a local initiative, team and
                        community around a new STEM Hub. This would essentially
                        drive more of the attending groups of the event to work
                        more closely with each other to generate greater success
                        in STEM fields for the younger population.

                        Matt Gill, CEO of Enhance-VR, was a guest speaker
                        focusing his talk on the potentials of virtual reality
                        (VR). “This technology has the ability to connect,
                        train, and certify more individuals [students] than any
                        training or classroom program in existence today - it’s
                        exactly what we all should be taking advantage of.” said
                        Gill.

                        It’s often not believed that great companies were
                        created from a couple of people meeting up for a cup of
                        coffee - but that’s exactly what happened with Global
                        Cloud Solutions (GCS) and Enhance-VR (EVR).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both companies operate out of the Koffman Southern Tier
                        incubator where often many of the teams find themselves
                        having an afternoon cup of Java-Joes in the kitchen
                        area. This last fall however, Matt Gill of EVR and Tom
                        Gilligan of GCS kicked off some conversations on what
                        each other’s companies do, and inevitably possible
                        opportunities as well. GCS has been creating custom web
                        tools for years that allow many of their clients to
                        connect and understand their in-house processes better.
                        Whether it’s Salesforce or Quoting tools, GCS has made a
                        great reputation for database driven solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        EVR has been actively looking at how they can make
                        setting up, operating and gathering information in
                        virtual reality training as easy as possible… and now
                        they can. With an initial prototype already developed,
                        GCS and EVR have successfully made a platform that
                        allows a user the ability to control content, users,
                        user data and track performance for not just one, but
                        over a hundred headsets at once for a client. All from a
                        single web tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This massive step will allow EVR to offer more
                        opportunities in training for their clients -
                        essentially creating a “Training Management System”. If
                        you’re interested to learn more about how EVR’s new
                        system can help your training, contact us! You can also

                        will be hosting a webinar on virtual reality (VR) open

                        signup). The ~ 1 hour long seminar will cover the
                        following and more through Q&A and discussion with
                        attendees:

                    <p>
                        The objective of the talk is to cover a wide range of
                        material that will hopefully answer many questions
                        people may have about implementing the technology in
                        their work environment. Upstate Safety Services
                        Marketing Director Justin Cochran will cover their
                        initial efforts and reasons why they’re researching the
                        uses of VR for their safety training. They have some
                        example content to share that was developed by
                        Enhance-VR.

                        partnership with SUNY Broome over last summer for 5
                        weeks. We taught them 3D modeling skills, having them
                        produce two “renderings” of scenes to show their
                        artistic and modeling skills. Then taught them basic C#
                        skills and the Unity platform to develop a “Marble Roll”
                        game, which they customized, and as a team - a 4 player
                        VR game. The game was open to the building to play with
                        a great response.
