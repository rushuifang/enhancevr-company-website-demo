                        Designing and building is my passion, from classic car
                        restorations to motion simulators - I want to imagine,
                        design, build, and create. I'm hard working and always
                        want to learn more such that I can improve myself and
                        help others in the process. Nothing is impossible, only
                        harder to achieve and I believe I can with perseverance
                        and dedication. To better mankind can be done not just
                        through meaningful devices or businesses but from
                        inspiration as well. If I saw something that I didn't
                        believe was possible - I would be inspired to seek the
                        impossible. <br /><br />Aside from classes, I run for
                        Binghamton University's Track and Cross Country teams.
                        Running has always been a part of my life and I know
                        I'll still be doing it far beyond school. If I'm not
                        running, biking, or working on a project, I'm out on the
                        water sailing. I love the sport and the lifestyle of
                        sailing and hopefully one day have the chance to
                        circumnavigate (or at least own a boat of my own).
